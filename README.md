# Plugin-Workspace
 Plugin loader/api/utilities for Java

This repo contains an eclipse workspace which contains an api for implementing a plugin system geared towards game modification.

Ideally you use the plugin loader api in your game, while the players just have to import the plugin interface without needing to interact with the game code at all.
